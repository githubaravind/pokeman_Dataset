1.	Pokémon is a group of adorable creatures peacefully colonizing a planet until humans come along and make them combat each other in order to get shiny badges and we can call them Pokémon masters.
2.	In this universe, there exists a group of rare and often strong Pokémon, known as Legendary Pokémon. Unfortunately, there are no detailed criteria that define these Pokémon.
3.	The only way to recognize a Legendary Pokémon is through information from official media, such as the game or anime.
4.	This data set includes 721 Pokémon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. The legend of a Pokémon cannot be suspected only by its Attack and Defense. It would be worth finding which variables can define the legend of a Pokémon. The strategy is to analyze the data and perform a predictive task of classification to predict the legend of a Pokémon using a decision tree algorithm.
